## Coverage
A detailed HTML coverage report was generated by ReportGenerator.  Open `CoverageReport/index.html` in your browser for interactive drill-down (class, method, and branch level).  Key coverage indicators at the time of generation:

* **Line coverage:** 16.7 % (solution-wide; Services namespace â‰¥ 95 %)
* **Branch coverage:** see `CoverageReport/badge_branchcoverage.svg`
* **Method coverage:** see `CoverageReport/badge_methodcoverage.svg`

> Note  The global percentage is reduced because view-layer and EF-migrations code are intentionally excluded from the test suite.  Critical business logic (Services, DTO validation, recommendation engine, price updater) is above 95 % line & branch coverage.
